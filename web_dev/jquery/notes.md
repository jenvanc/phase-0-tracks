## What sorts of resources will help?
I plan on using youtube and the jQuery documentation to help bring me up to speed on jQuery. I may head over to Codecademy and take a look at their jQuery course as that will be a place to find simple exercises to work through. I don't always find these exercises helpful for learning good techniques, for me they just help with syntax so it is typically not the first place I go for information.

## How often should you stop and test what you just learned? Are breaks important?
I will try to break about every half hour or so, I'm typically not very good when it comes to taking routine breaks because I feel it can sometimes impact my work flow. I typically take a break for about 20 minutes if I feel there is an exceptionally difficult concept for me to wrap my head around.

## Most effective
For me, the documentation and videos really are the most helpful, for the time allowed this was a good strategy. It helps to see the potential of jQuery in various projects an to see someone do it in real time is quite helpful.
