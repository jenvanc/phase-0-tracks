		<h1>All about cats!</h1>
			<p>Cats are small, furry little creatures that you can have as a pet. They purr when happy and make great companions. Here are some things you should know before bringing a cat home. Cats are not <em>always</em> the most independent pets. This is a misconception that cats are quite solitary and prefer to keep to themselves most of the time. Just like people have different personalities, so do cats. A cat could be very aloof or wanting to be on your lap whenever you are home. There are <strong>loads</strong> of cats in shelters that need a good home. Be sure to learn more about <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cat_behavior">cat behavior</a> before adopting.</p>
