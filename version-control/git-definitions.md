# Git Definitions

**Instructions: ** Define each of the following Git concepts.

* What is version control?  Why is it useful?
Version control keeps a complete history of every change made to the repository. It allows collaboration and rollbacks to the code if they become necessary. It allows you to see who made what changes.

* What is a branch and why would you use one?
A branch is a copy of the master where you can make changes to the code in isolation. It is much easier to fix broken code a branch instead of the master. It allows for independent work without having to worry about having an impact on those working on the same project.

* What is a commit? What makes a good commit message?
A commit is a save point in a project. When marking with a commit message, it should be short but descriptive of the changes saved inside.

* What is a merge conflict?
A merge conflict occurs when two people make changes to the same portion of the same project and then try to merge it together.
