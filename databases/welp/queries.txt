1. You've joined two tables before. How do you join three?
INPUT :
SELECT * FROM businesses, users, reviews
   ...> WHERE businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> AND users.id = reviews.user_id ;

OUTPUT :
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|2|Mandy|Kaling|1|3|Elvis was drunk, but sang beautifully|1|2
3|The Beagle Nightclub|1|Bradford|Pitt|2|5|This is the best nightclub ever|3|1
2|Amir's Towing|3|Angela|Jolie|3|1|Took forever to get into my car|2|3



2. There are some repetitive columns if we choose to view all fields. Choose instead to just view the user's names, the business name, the star rating, and the comment.
INPUT:
SELECT
   ...> first_name,
   ...> last_name,
   ...> name,
   ...> stars,
   ...> comment
   ...> FROM
   ...> businesses, users, reviews
   ...> WHERE businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> AND users.id = reviews.user_id ;

OUTPUT:
Mandy|Kaling|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|3|Elvis was drunk, but sang beautifully
Bradford|Pitt|The Beagle Nightclub|5|This is the best nightclub ever
Angela|Jolie|Amir's Towing|1|Took forever to get into my car

3. How do you view the data of all three tables for just one particular business?
INPUT:
SELECT * FROM businesses, users, reviews
   ...> WHERE businesses.id = reviews.business_id
   ...> AND users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> AND businesses.id = 1 ;

OUTPUT:
1|Grundy Hollow Wedding Chapel|2|Mandy|Kaling|1|3|Elvis was drunk, but sang beautifully|1|2

AND

INPUT:
SELECT users.first_name, users.last_name, businesses.name, reviews.stars, reviews.comment
   ...> FROM users INNER JOIN
   ...> (businesses INNER JOIN reviews ON businesses.id = reviews.business_id)
   ...> ON users.id = reviews.user_id
   ...> WHERE businesses.name="Amir's Towing";

OUTPUT:
Angela|Jolie|Amir's Towing|1|Took forever to get into my car
